                <br>Hi! My name is Daniel Ayoung-Chee and my pronouns are 
                he/him/his. I am a second year CS major and recently 
                transferred from the University of Florida, but I actually 
                heard of BoG much earlier, and have always been highly 
                interested in joining. When I went to high school in Miami, 
                I would go to my local Chinese School every week to 
                volunteer, whether it was at events or weekly classroom 
                organization. I love volunteering because there is nothing 
                more fun than being able to help make a positive impact towards 
                my own community and I think it is the most fulfilling 
                activity I could do. If you want to check me out, here's 
                my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dan.cheez/?hl=en"
